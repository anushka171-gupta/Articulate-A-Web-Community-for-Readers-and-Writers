# Articulate (A Web Community for Readers and Writers)
With the coming of free online writing platforms, writers have been able to showcase their work more openly and easily. The objective of this project is to provide one such platform to users so that they can connect with their audience easily. Users can easily write their stories in rich text format and allow their readers to view them.
